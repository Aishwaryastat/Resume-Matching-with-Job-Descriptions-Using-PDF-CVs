# Resume-Matching-with-Job-Descriptions-Using-PDF-CVs

In the relentless quest for the perfect candidate, every recruiter knows the pain of sifting through stacks of resumes. Enter our project: "Resume Matching with Job Descriptions." We harnessed the power of advanced AI technologies to streamline the hiring process.

**Key Highlights:**

- **PDF Extraction Wizardry**: We've developed a sophisticated PDF extractor capable of handling over 2000 different resume formats. This allows us to effortlessly digitize resumes and extract valuable information.

- **Hugging Face Dataset**: To define the ideal candidate, we harnessed the Hugging Face job description dataset. This extensive collection of job postings acts as our reference guide for the perfect match.

- **BERT and DistilBERT Transforms**: We employed state-of-the-art NLP models like BERT and DistilBERT to process both the resumes and job descriptions. These models help us understand the context, skills, and qualifications required for each job.

- **Cosine Similarity**: Leveraging cosine similarity, we compare the resumes against the job descriptions. This metric helps us gauge how closely a candidate's qualifications align with the job's requirements.

- **Top 5 Matching Resumes**: The icing on the cake is our ability to present recruiters with the top 5 matching resumes for each job description. This feature saves time, ensures a higher quality of selection, and makes the hiring process more efficient.

Experience the future of talent acquisition with our "Resume Matching with Job Descriptions" project, where we transform the daunting hiring process into a breeze. Say goodbye to the stacks of resumes and hello to the perfect candidate, every time.
